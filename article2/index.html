                In 2014, a widely shared youtube video recorded a dispute between tech bros in San Francisco’s Mission
                District and local youth over the use of a public soccer field.[1] The tech bros insisted on their
                entitlement to use the field exclusively for 1-hour by presenting a San Francisco Recreation and Parks
                Department permit that for the cost $27 would reinforce their claim. The permit’s legitimacy was
                contested by the youth who countered that in the local custom, the field had never been “booked,” and
                thus could not be “booked” now simply because one possessed a permit. The tech bros’ incredulity that
                the document they held—in this case, a banal graphic design artifact that facilitates the governance of
                space—did not possess the legitimacy to back their claim is this text’s object of inquiry.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                I would like to use this incident to open a consideration of the extent to which graphic design has been
                mobilized as an instrument of statemaking, and via colonization, impose a normative universalization of
                its logic. The park permit, as a graphic artifact, with its attendant references to maps and
                legislation, and to the extent that it enables a presumption of the legitimacy of its issuing agency and
                the claims of its holders, supplies a lens through which the persistence of colonial dispossession can
                be apprehended in its most banal forms, and hopefully, can inversely contribute to articulating
                possibilities of subversion.

            <p class="paragraph">
                The independent journal of landscape architecture and political economy, Scapegoat, [2] opens its first
                issue with the assertion that private property is to be understood as the “literal foundation” of
                architecture and landscape architecture practice, where each project begins with a site that is “already
                drawn.” [3] This paper attempts to outline a similarly fundamental insight with regards to graphic
                design. It focuses on typography, mapping, and the writing of legislation—each representing what Bruno
                Latour might consider “deflated” forms, or what Lisa Gitelman might regard as “genres” of graphic
                design—as primary constituents of an entanglement between graphic design and state power. In other
                words, graphic design is understood here as a practice where typography, mapping and legislation, not
                only make design’s entanglement with power particularly evident, but to the extent that they are
                embodied by standards, are precisely constitutive of their own status as faits accompli, or “already
                drawn.”
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                This text is an initial foray into probing the extent to which is “already drawn,” or what I will refer
                to throughout as standards and conventions (that which has moved beyond mutability or contestation),
                constitute the presumptive site on which graphic design practice is built to facilitate “…determined
                [hierarchical]…relations as [ostensibly] open aesthetic possibilities,”[4] and to propose that standards
                and conventions be understood indeed as politically constituted and thus available as sites of
                contestation through design practice. The kind of question this begs then is how? For instance, if maps,
                rather than “represent[ing] geographies or ideas… effect their actualization,” [5] what is it that
                sustains this effect? What gives a document like the park permit, or a colonial map for that matter, its
                power to define, to make immutable fact, establish convention, and to make incredulous or violent those
                who encounter an “illiteracy” of its claims?
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                What is at stake in the recognition of the contingency—that is, the political dimension—of writing,
                mapping and law, stabilized by their conventionality, is the affirmation of testimony and claims that
                fall outside the statist/colonial forms of legitimacy these underwrite. This project is partly inspired
                by the Dene scholar Glenn Coulthard’s critical work on Indigenous land claims struggles that assert an
                ontology of land as cultural and reciprocal (what he terms “grounded normativity”) [6], as opposed to
                commercial and commodifiable (what I’ll call “settler normativity”). Land claims politics in Canada has
                been characterized by an irreconcilable epistemological agonism where the Canadian state’s legal gaze
                understands land solely as property/commodity, and the more radical elements of the Indigenous struggle
                reject this and instead see it as cultural. The Indigenous argument for cultural rights (which the
                Canadian state insists is distinct from political rights) then figures an ontological understanding of
                the land as “…a field of ‘relationships of things to each other,’” [7] as opposed to land as objective
                commodity in the form of private property (valorized as such through colonial dispossession).
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                The premise that I am attempting to establish in what follows is a narrative of graphic design
                functioning as an instrument of dispossession and colonization. [8] What I posit is that the graphic
                genres mentioned above (typography, mapping, legislation) mobilized by the settler state to validate its
                claims and render its land legible as property, privilege the empirical while holding a conceit of
                objectivity (precisely by virtue of their status as visible, being outside any individual subject),
                simultaneously making illegible and therefore “illegal” any form of “grounded normativity.” My hope is
                that doing so will help build a discursive ground which puts into relief graphic design’s coloniality,
                while scrutinizing its recesses to address problems of colonial legitimacy.

            <p class="paragraph"><b>Typography and Myth</b></p>
            <p class="paragraph">I begin with the contention that the Cree syllabary was ostensibly the first typeface
                to ever be designed within the settler-state now known as Canada.[9] However, I am less interested in
                the merit that it was the first, and rather seek to address the notion that it was designed. Benedict
                Anderson’s account of print-capitalism casts typography as an actant that compelled the standardization
                of language and the imagination of national communities.[10] Furthermore, following Anderson’s
                accounting of the role that myths play in the production of a shared origin story that underwrites
                nationalistic sentiment, I contend that it is precisely typographic history, particularly in the context
                of national/colonial myth-making, that casts typography and printing as a modernizing/civilizing agent.

            <p class="paragraph">Winona Stevenson, an Indigenous Studies scholar at the University of Saskatoon,
                recounts the story of Calling Badger—a Wood Cree elder who received the Cree writing system (which has
                now been adapted for use in numerous Indigenous languages).</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“On his way to a sacred society meeting one evening Calling Badger and two singers came
                upon a bright light and all three fell to the ground. Out of the light came a voice speaking Calling
                Badger’s name. Soon after, Calling Badger fell ill and the people heard he had passed away. During his
                wake three days later, while preparing to roll him in buffalo robes for the funeral, the people
                discovered that his body was not stiff like a dead person’s body should be. Against all customs and
                tradition the people agreed to the widow’s request to let the body sit one more night. The next day
                Calling Badger’s body was still not stiff so the old people began rubbing his back and chest. Soon his
                eyes opened and he told the people he had gone to the Fourth World, the spirit world, and there the
                spirits taught him many things. Calling Badger told the people of the things he was shown that
                prophesized events in the future, then he pulled out some pieces of birch bark with symbols on them.
                These symbols, he told the people were to be used to write down the spirit languages, and for the Cree
                people to use to communicate among themselves.”</p>
