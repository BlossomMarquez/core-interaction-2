                In 2014, a widely shared youtube video recorded a dispute between tech bros in San Francisco’s Mission
                District and local youth over the use of a public soccer field.<a href="#1">[1]</a> The tech bros insisted on their
                entitlement to use the field exclusively for 1-hour by presenting a San Francisco Recreation and Parks
                Department permit that for the cost $27 would reinforce their claim. The permit’s legitimacy was
                contested by the youth who countered that in the local custom, the field had never been “booked,” and
                thus could not be “booked” now simply because one possessed a permit. The tech bros’ incredulity that
                the document they held—in this case, a banal graphic design artifact that facilitates the governance of
                space—did not possess the legitimacy to back their claim is this text’s object of inquiry.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                I would like to use this incident to open a consideration of the extent to which graphic design has been
                mobilized as an instrument of statemaking, and via colonization, impose a normative universalization of
                its logic. The park permit, as a graphic artifact, with its attendant references to maps and
                legislation, and to the extent that it enables a presumption of the legitimacy of its issuing agency and
                the claims of its holders, supplies a lens through which the persistence of colonial dispossession can
                be apprehended in its most banal forms, and hopefully, can inversely contribute to articulating
                possibilities of subversion.

                The independent journal of landscape architecture and political economy, Scapegoat, <a href="#2">[2]</a> opens its first
                issue with the assertion that private property is to be understood as the “literal foundation” of
                architecture and landscape architecture practice, where each project begins with a site that is “already
                drawn.” <a href="#3" name="3link"> [3]</a> This paper attempts to outline a similarly fundamental insight with regards to graphic
                design. It focuses on typography, mapping, and the writing of legislation—each representing what Bruno
                Latour might consider “deflated” forms, or what Lisa Gitelman might regard as “genres” of graphic
                design—as primary constituents of an entanglement between graphic design and state power. In other
                words, graphic design is understood here as a practice where typography, mapping and legislation, not
                only make design’s entanglement with power particularly evident, but to the extent that they are
                embodied by standards, are precisely constitutive of their own status as faits accompli, or “already
                drawn.”
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                This text is an initial foray into probing the extent to which is “already drawn,” or what I will refer
                to throughout as standards and conventions (that which has moved beyond mutability or contestation),
                constitute the presumptive site on which graphic design practice is built to facilitate “…determined
                [hierarchical]…relations as [ostensibly] open aesthetic possibilities,”[4] and to propose that standards
                and conventions be understood indeed as politically constituted and thus available as sites of
                contestation through design practice. The kind of question this begs then is how? For instance, if maps,
                rather than “represent[ing] geographies or ideas… effect their actualization,” [5] what is it that
                sustains this effect? What gives a document like the park permit, or a colonial map for that matter, its
                power to define, to make immutable fact, establish convention, and to make incredulous or violent those
                who encounter an “illiteracy” of its claims?
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                What is at stake in the recognition of the contingency—that is, the political dimension—of writing,
                mapping and law, stabilized by their conventionality, is the affirmation of testimony and claims that
                fall outside the statist/colonial forms of legitimacy these underwrite. This project is partly inspired
                by the Dene scholar Glenn Coulthard’s critical work on Indigenous land claims struggles that assert an
                ontology of land as cultural and reciprocal (what he terms “grounded normativity”) [6], as opposed to
                commercial and commodifiable (what I’ll call “settler normativity”). Land claims politics in Canada has
                been characterized by an irreconcilable epistemological agonism where the Canadian state’s legal gaze
                understands land solely as property/commodity, and the more radical elements of the Indigenous struggle
                reject this and instead see it as cultural. The Indigenous argument for cultural rights (which the
                Canadian state insists is distinct from political rights) then figures an ontological understanding of
                the land as “…a field of ‘relationships of things to each other,’” [7] as opposed to land as objective
                commodity in the form of private property (valorized as such through colonial dispossession).
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                The premise that I am attempting to establish in what follows is a narrative of graphic design
                functioning as an instrument of dispossession and colonization. [8] What I posit is that the graphic
                genres mentioned above (typography, mapping, legislation) mobilized by the settler state to validate its
                claims and render its land legible as property, privilege the empirical while holding a conceit of
                objectivity (precisely by virtue of their status as visible, being outside any individual subject),
                simultaneously making illegible and therefore “illegal” any form of “grounded normativity.” My hope is
                that doing so will help build a discursive ground which puts into relief graphic design’s coloniality,
                while scrutinizing its recesses to address problems of colonial legitimacy.

                I begin with the contention that the Cree syllabary was ostensibly the first typeface
                to ever be designed within the settler-state now known as Canada.[9] However, I am less interested in
                the merit that it was the first, and rather seek to address the notion that it was designed. Benedict
                Anderson’s account of print-capitalism casts typography as an actant that compelled the standardization
                of language and the imagination of national communities.[10] Furthermore, following Anderson’s
                accounting of the role that myths play in the production of a shared origin story that underwrites
                nationalistic sentiment, I contend that it is precisely typographic history, particularly in the context
                of national/colonial myth-making, that casts typography and printing as a modernizing/civilizing agent.

                Winona Stevenson, an Indigenous Studies scholar at the University of Saskatoon,
                recounts the story of Calling Badger—a Wood Cree elder who received the Cree writing system (which has
                now been adapted for use in numerous Indigenous languages).</p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                “On his way to a sacred society meeting one evening Calling Badger and two singers came
                upon a bright light and all three fell to the ground. Out of the light came a voice speaking Calling
                Badger’s name. Soon after, Calling Badger fell ill and the people heard he had passed away. During his
                wake three days later, while preparing to roll him in buffalo robes for the funeral, the people
                discovered that his body was not stiff like a dead person’s body should be. Against all customs and
                tradition the people agreed to the widow’s request to let the body sit one more night. The next day
                Calling Badger’s body was still not stiff so the old people began rubbing his back and chest. Soon his
                eyes opened and he told the people he had gone to the Fourth World, the spirit world, and there the
                spirits taught him many things. Calling Badger told the people of the things he was shown that
                prophesized events in the future, then he pulled out some pieces of birch bark with symbols on them.
                These symbols, he told the people were to be used to write down the spirit languages, and for the Cree
                people to use to communicate among themselves.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                This story contradicts the colonial history of Cree script, which attributes its invention in 1840 to
                English linguist and missionary James Evans, who melted down the clasps of his tea chest to create type
                slugs and printed translations of religious texts and hymns. One story, borne out by documentary
                evidence, attesting to the ingenuity and benefit of the European settler, is considered plausible and
                credible—fact. Evans’ printing specimens are preserved and available to researchers; there are other
                sources that corroborate his story; it is possible to draw formal and conceptual continuity between the
                Cree syllabary and Evans’ knowledge of Devanagari and Pitman shorthand.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                On the other hand, the oral history recalled by Stevenson, attributes the creation of the writing system
                to the spirit world and its transmission through Calling Badger leaves no hard evidence, no “mobile
                immutable”[11] that can be traced back and verified, nothing to scan and reprint or upload—no original
                document. Outside of an epistemological framework underwritten by empirical observation, such claims are
                invalid and reminiscent of fraud, deceit, belief, blind faith, abuse, dangerous irrationality. It seems
                hardly necessary to go beyond my own problematic reading of the story as evidence to support my
                presumption that the Indigenous story would often, at best, be trivialized with patronizing curiosity
                and at worst dismissed as primitive mythology.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                I propose that the gap between these two stories could be understood (in very general terms) as the gap
                between a European colonial epistemology and an Indigenous one. To illustrate this, I point to the
                conceptual consistency between the contentious typographic history described above and the Indigenous
                land claims struggle in Canada. Where a settler-normative epistemology is imbricated with a statist
                ontology of land as commodity/property, the phenomenon of the typographic object is attributable to a
                legal individual’s intellectual authorship. This would be counterposed to an Indigenous “grounded
                normativity” which is imbricated with an ontology of land as reciprocal relationship, a kind of medium
                that is immune to private ownership. This is to suggest that the ontological status of the script
                differs radically according to the possibility of producing empirical evidence. The document—a graphic
                artifact—thus performs an evidentiary function [12] and affords the narrative for which it does so the
                distinction of being historical or, “already drawn.”
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Perhaps one way to challenge the diminishing of that which leaks outside of the indemnity of colonial
                epistemology would be a deliberate performance of illiteracy—a deflection of its insistence on the
                visible, empirical and privileging of objectivity as the sole guarantee of validity and legitimacy. This
                need not be a wholesale rejection of empirical validation, but rather a strategic deflection of
                empiricism as an instrument of colonial dispossession, both spatial and cultural. To claim then that the
                script was “designed” (with an author as its source) and not “received” (from the spirit world) is the
                reinscription of a settler-normative form of historical validation based on the availability of
                documentary evidence (the “already-drawn”) towards the production of national settler mythology.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Though the actual story may be somewhere in between the Evans and the Calling Badger story (for example,
                that the writing system had been in use when the Cree encountered the missionaries, but that the
                missionaries took credit for its invention), it is more interesting to consider the Evans story as an
                instrument of national myth-making. The official rhetoric of Canadian state multiculturalism, for
                instance, ought to be understood as being entangled with the legitimization of the settler-multicultural
                colonial state, in the sense that it casts as unproblematic, and certainly beneficial, the presence of
                European settlers on Turtle Island.[13] If that were acknowledged, then what we’re dealing with either
                way are different mythologies. What could then be ventured is that a deliberate neglect of documentary
                evidence and empiricism—or what Walter Mignolo might call a form of “epistemic disobedience”—is a
                politically valid deflection of a persistent settler-normativity.

            <p class="paragraph">
                The premise of the section that follows is that the notion of legibility—as a concern both in graphic
                design and statecraft—brings into the spectrum of concerns, agendas and forms that are not typically
                associated with graphic design, mapping and legislation, as politically consequential modes of practice.
                What is sought through this exercise is an understanding of the mobilization of graphic artifacts in
                producing normative standards rooted in modernist, bourgeois liberalism as the basis of (settler)
                legitimacy.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                The anthropologist James C. Scott describes the development of the scientific forest as a prime example
                of the way landscape is designed in order to make it legible. Mid-19th-century Prussian foresters,
                seeking to manage unregulated and unsustainable forestry practices sought to design a landscape that
                would facilitate the rational management of lumber harvests. The foresters desired to form the land in a
                way that could be managed from the overview perspective of a chart inscribed with numerical
                representations and arranged with graphical logic. The illegible wild forest was thus transformed to
                reflect the ordered legibility of the chart in a turn to what I call “the banality of ‘excel.’”[14] In
                the short-term this enabled a more accountable means of managing lumber harvests, and would ostensibly
                create a more sustainable supply. However, the long-term result was the foresters realizing that their
                designed landscapes were not in fact as sustainable as they had anticipated because the
                biological/nutritional deficiency of simplified ecosystems made the forests more vulnerable to disease
                and extreme weather. What they had failed to account for were precisely those things that were illegible
                to a gaze that was conditioned by commerce and economistic calculation—the dynamic inter-relationality
                of insect life, rodents, ground-plants, animal droppings, and so on, that were constitutive of the
                landscape’s vitality.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Such myopia characterizes the Canadian state’s illiteracy when it comes to an understanding of land that
                mediates “forms of life” and their attendant cultures, illegible to a statist gaze. Rather the Canadian
                state prefers to separate land and culture in a way that allows for the recognition of Indigenous
                “culture” on the condition of a consensual understanding of land as property. Quoting Paul Nadasdy,
                Coulthard points out that “…‘to engage in the process of negotiating a land-claim agreement, First
                Nations people must translate their complex reciprocal relationship with the land into the equally
                complex but very different language of ‘property.’” [15]
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Property is something that landscape architect and theorist James Corner would characterize as a
                “…phenomena that can only achieve visibility through representation rather than through direct
                experience.”[16] The spectrum of what is made legible on the proverbial map of the Canadian state, makes
                recognizing Indigenous “land rights” claims mean little more than the right to buy and sell land in a
                market regulated by the state.

                In seeking the source of this colonial ontology of land-as-property and the coordinates by which it can
                be regulated, we can go again to James C. Scott who reminds us that one of the aims of the French
                Revolution was the establishment of “one king, one law, one weight and one measure.” It was declared
                that the Revolution had given the people the metre![17] A common grievance brought to the cahiers de
                dolénces (statement of grievances) was the arbitrariness of the standards used by local aristocrats and
                the clergy, that through customary arrangements, left subject populations vulnerable to economic abuse.
                Scott supplies examples of the various ways in which a landlord might abuse such customary feudal rental
                arrangements to dispossess their tenants of their production.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                “The local lord might, for example, lend grain to peasants in smaller baskets and insist on repayment in
                larger baskets. He might surreptitiously or even boldly enlarge the size of the grain sacks accepted for
                milling (a monopoly of the domain lord) and reduce the size of the sacks used for measuring out flour;
                he might also collect feudal dues in larger baskets and pay wages in kind in smaller baskets. While the
                formal custom governing feudal dues and wages would thus remain intact (requiring, for example, the same
                number of sacks of wheat from the harvest of a given holding), the actual transaction might increasingly
                favor the lord.”[18]
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Here the politics of standards and measurement are at play. For Scott, “every act of measurement was an

            <p class="paragraph">
                In the early years of the new Republic, a proposal was made by “revolutionary architects”[20] for a
                monument to be built on the site of the former Bastille prison that would commemorate (and be immutably
                set in stone and metal) a new system of standardized weights and measures. While this was never actually
                built, the French Academy of Sciences was commissioned to devise a new rational system that would
                displace the traditional legal privileges of the aristocracy and clergy. These would eventually
                materialize as objects—the metre, for instance, was a stick that was, well, a metre, but whose length
                was to be determined as one ten-millionth of the distance from the North Pole to the Equator. Other
                standardized units, like the kilogram, were derived tautologically from the volume of one-thousandth of
                a cubic meter of pure water. The public validity of these standards rested on the impersonal, empirical
                phenomena on which they were derived, and were thus held up as objective and immune to the traditional
                and arbitrary forms of adjudication and administration of the old local standards. They embodied a
                graphic foundation for legislation whose immutable metallic composition, esoteric and scientific
                rationalization stood in for the infallible authority of a state whose legitimacy would no longer need
                to rest on the monarch’s divine right to rule. This system of standards would become a universalized
                inheritance whose validity rested on a conceit of rational objectivity (and the state power to uphold
                that conceit). It was also part of a political commitment to the legislation and regulation of markets
                for a bourgeoisie now liberated from the relative inequities of the ancien régime.

            <p class="paragraph">
                Though the newly minted settler republic, the United States of America, would not adopt the metric
                system, the same political/ethical principles of a universal standard were applied to its landscape in
                the form of the Jeffersonian Grid (1785). The Jeffersonian Grid was essentially the partitioning of land
                into one square mile parcels. It represents a rationalization of the landscape, making it subject to the
                legal order (the legibility) of the state. Indeed the map functions as a visualization that figures land
                as property precisely through its graphic design(ation) as such. The (colonial) state ratifies this
                designation by virtue of its capacity to impose its definitions through force (legality). To illustrate,
                I digress only slightly. Take for instance the Water Protector who famously disarmed the armed security
                contractor/infiltrator at Standing Rock and is now being criminalized for “terrorizing” said
                infiltrator.[21] The way in which an armed infiltrator is figured as the victim by the courts is a
                testament to the metaphysical power of the state. The Jeffersonian Grid manifests the ideals of a
                bourgeois state and thus superimposes them as a graphic articulation of liberal universalist values on
                an otherwise contingent, variegated and plural landscape. The map then produces a kind of “Heisenberg
                effect” to the extent that the gaze of the state, made operational by its epistemological apparatus
                (mapping, legislation) valorize an ontological status of land-as-property while simultaneously rendering
                illegal (illegible) an ontology of land not as discrete object but as a medium through which reciprocal
                economic relationships are facilitated.

                What was fought for in Europe as the basis of a value system, a set of standards (the “already drawn”)
                upon which the laws of a democratic republic could be built, would be violently imposed on Turtle Island
                (amongst other colonies) as “enlightened” and “civilized,” ontologizing land as legible commodity
                (governable, legal), regulated by a statist/colonial legal apparatus (courts, police, military, schools,
                etc.) and rendering illegible (ungovernable, illegal) local/indigenous forms of governance and exchange.
                The inherited consensus of rational and irreducible standards obscure the possibility of “thick”
                potentials of plural and indeed, antagonistic definitions of land, myth and law that could privilege
                Indigenous ones and trivialize colonial ones. Perhaps a project of decolonizing graphic design calls
                for, as the youth in San Francisco demonstrated, strategic and deliberate performances of illiteracy—or
                to use Mignolo’s more deliberate and energetic term, a carrying out of “epistemic disobedience.” As a
                corollary, one task for decolonized design may be the pluralization and invention of forms and standards
                that reinforce epistemologies of land that require different literacies that deflect the colonial one,
                and for these forms of literacy to saturate processes of social reproduction that are countervalent to
                the colonial ones. What this looks like for those registers of graphic design that have been entangled
                with state power—typography, mapping and legislation—how much of its current disciplinary boundary ought
                to be retained, abandoned or more explicitly and critically engaged in order to mutate the conventional
                scope of the discipline, how much it needs to shift its concerns and modes of practice to consider this
                possibility, is a question for much further inquiry.
