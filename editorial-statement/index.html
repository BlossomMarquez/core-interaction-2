      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Much of the academic and professional discourse within the design disciplines over the last century has been
        bereft of a critical reflection on the politics of design practice, and on the politics of the artifacts,
        systems and practices that designerly activity produces. Our premise is that— notwithstanding important and
        valued exceptions—design theory, practice, and pedagogy as a whole are not geared towards delivering the kinds
        of knowledge and understanding that are adequate to addressing longstanding systemic issues of power.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        These issues are products of modernity and its ideologies, regimes, and institutions reiterating, producing and
        exerting continued colonial power upon the lives of oppressed, marginalized, and subaltern peoples in both the
        ‘developed’ and ‘developing’ world. This planet, shared and co-inhabited by a plurality of peoples, each
        inhabiting different worlds, each orienting themselves within and towards their environments in different ways,
        and with different civilizational histories, is being undermined by a globalized system of power that threatens
        to flatten and eradicate ontological and epistemological difference, rewriting histories and advance visions of
        a future for a privileged few at the expense of their human and nonhuman others.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        To date, mainstream design discourse has been dominated by a focus on Anglocentric/Eurocentric ways of seeing,
        knowing, and acting in the world, with little attention being paid to alternative and marginalized discourses
        from the non Anglo-European sphere, or the nature and consequences of design-as-politics today. This narrowness
        of horizons and deficiency in criticality is a reflection of the limitations of the institutions within which
        design is studied and practiced, as well as of the larger socio-political systems that design is institutionally
        integrated into.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        We believe that a sharper lens needs to be brought to bear on non-western ways of thinking and being, and on the
        way that class, gender, race, etc,. issues are designed today. We understand the highlighting of these issues
        through practices and acts of design, and the (re)design of institutions, design practices and design studies
        (efforts that always occur under conditions of contested political interests) to be a pivotal challenge in the
        process of decolonisation. We also want to move beyond academic discourse to critique and think around the ideas
        and practices that circulate through the work of professional designers embedded in the various sectors of
        production that stimulate and sustain the modern/colonial world economy.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Our goal is ontological rather than additive change. It is not sufficient for design institutions to simply
        include a greater diversity of actors or perspectives. This only goes to serve a delaying and offsetting demands
        for radical systemic change. While we support and defend measures to include marginalized subjects and our/their
        concerns in spaces from which we/they have been excluded or remain precarious, we also believe there is little
        point to diversifying institutions, practices, and processes that ultimately sustain colonial imperatives. Our
        aim is not to direct our efforts to prop up existing power structures, or to sustaining them through
        ameliorative measures. Rather, our aim should be nothing less than to seek the radical transfiguration of these
        structures through the critical eye of the programmatic imagination that dares to identify the possibilities and
        conditions that will give us alternatives to the now.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Our objective—as design scholars and practitioners—is to transform the very terms of present day design studies
        and research. Designers can put to task their skills, techniques, and mentalities to designing futures aimed at
        advancing ecological, social, and technological conditions where multiple worlds and knowledges, involving both
        humans and nonhumans, can flourish in mutually enhancing ways. For us, decolonisation is not simply one more
        option or approach among others within design discourse. Rather, it is a fundamental imperative to which all
        design endeavors must be oriented.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        It is with the aim of providing an outlet for voices from the fringes, the voices of the marginal and the
        suppressed in design discourse, that we have opened this platform. We welcome all of those who work silently and
        surely on the edges and outskirts of the discipline to join and contribute to conversations that question and
        critique the politics of design practice today, where we can discuss strategies and tactics through which to
        engage with more mainstream discourse, and where we can collectively experiment with alternatives and
        reformulations of contemporary practice.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        We encourage and seek decentralized dialogues, in which different voices can coexist in their difference rather
        than in an assimilated narrative. In this platform we welcome:
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
      <ol>
        <li>Contributions from designers working at the intersections of materiality and culture, postcoloniality,
          decoloniality, gender studies, race studies, and other areas of human thought and action which seek to
          analyze,
          question and challenge the relations of power in the world today;
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>New curatorial practices of designerly knowledge, that seek to challenge and disrupt colonial understandings
          in
          the field and develop knowledge and understanding of how designs for decolonisation might be presented,
          discussed, published, disseminated, and so on;
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Reviews, interviews, debates, podcasts and other forms of discussion and debate beyond the confines of
          academic
          language. We also invite formats that are generally devalued within academic contexts such as visual essays,
          audio papers, performance works, etc.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Possibilities for the dissemination of critical thinking in design well beyond the canons of the discipline
          (e.g. design studies and/as epistemic disobedience);
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Critical pieces written originally in languages other than English; as well as potential translations into
          languages other than English;
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Critical pieces written by researchers, practitioners, independent scholars, and students in the process of
          completing their degrees and/or who feel they are marginalised or poorly supported by academic institutions.
          In
          other words, we welcome incomplete ideas, work-in-progress, and other forms of dealing with the questions
          above
          outlined, thus amplifying discourses outside the remit of institutes, which may or may not be projects
          enfolded
          in academic work.
        </li>
        <br>
      </ol>
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph">
        Moreover, we seek to connect with already existing endeavors within and beyond the design field for a
        decolonisation of not only academia, but all professional practices and pedagogies, to connect and foster
        exchanges of knowledge that speak from, cross, and remain in the borderlands of design and coloniality. Through
        this platform, and in collaboration with like minded others, we hope that we can make a substantial commitment
        to contributing to the continued existence, vitality and diversity of human presence on this planet.
