            <p class="paragraph">This is a group blog, composed by academics, researchers, and practitioners working in
                and with the fields
                of Design Studies and Design Research. As clarified on our <a href="../editorial-statement/index.html">Editorial</a>, this is a collective endeavour,
                born
                out from a general frustration with how design ontologies and epistemologies are constituted and
                validated
                within and outside academia. We think that one way to address this frustration was to foster other
                outlets
                and platforms, in which different forms of knowledge production could find their place.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                With that in mind, unless otherwise stated, contributions are individual, and as such responsible for
                its
                content; however, we do encourage dissensus. In other words, it means that disagreement and criticism is
                more than welcome; direct attacks, offensive language and downright dismissal of opinions are not, and
                will
                be most likely deleted.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                This platform is meant to be a plural space, but by no means a totalising one. We acknowledge that this
                endeavour has not started here, nor will it end here. We welcome submissions and proposals of various
                forms
                of content; if you would like to propose something that fits within or around our briefly outlined
                <a href="../editorial-statement/index.html">Editorial</a> statement, <a href="mailto:decolonisingdesign@gmail.com">email us</a>. While we do encourage all forms of submissions, we ask self-consciousness as to the
                amount of personal promotion, conference announcements/CFPs, or other divulgation material.
